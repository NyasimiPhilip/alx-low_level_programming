  <h2>Tasks üìÉ</h2>
  <h3>0. Django</h3>
  <p>dog.h: Header file that defines a new type struct dog with the following elements:</p>
  <ul>

    <li>char *owner</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>1. A dog is the only thing on earth that loves you more than you love yourself</h3>

  <h3>3. Outside of a dog, a book is a man's best friend. Inside of a dog it's too dark to read</h3>
